# Tech At Scale Blog
Created a static blog website (not live at the moment) for my husband using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (modern static site generator).

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Hugo

## Lessons Learned:
- Learned about Hugo and how their websites are structured.
- Learned about Markdown and how easy it is! 
- Incorporated an existing template and learned how to make custom html/css changes.
